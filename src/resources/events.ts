  /**
   * List Event Fields.
   *
   * Retrieves a list of Fields for a specific Event Type. These Fields are dynamic
   * and forward compatibile, enabling calculation operations on the Event schema.
   *
   * **Notes:**
   *
   * - In many of the Response schema for this call, such as when you retrieve the
   *   Fields for a `configuration.commitment.created` Event Type, `new` represents
   *   the attributes the newly created object has. The Response to a call to
   *   retrieve the Fields for a `configuration.commitment.updated` Event Type will
   *   contain Field values for both the `old` and `new` objects. The Response to a
   *   call to retrieve the Fields for a `configuration.commitment.deleted` Event
   *   Type will only contain `old` Fields, for values at point of deletion. Having
   *   access to reference both `new` and `old` Field values for an object can be
   *   very useful if you want to base a Notification rule on an Event and include a
   *   calculation in the rule that, for example, compares `new` values with `old` -
   *   for example, trigger a Notification only when a Commitment has been updated
   *   and the `new` value for the `amount` is at least $1,000 greater than the `old`
   *   value.
   * - Some Event types will show `customFields` even though the specific billing or
   *   configuration object the Event is for does not yet have the custom fields
   *   functionality implemented. For these Events, their `customFields` values will
   *   not be populated until such time as the custom fields functionality is
   *   implemented for them
