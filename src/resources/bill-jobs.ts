  /**
   * Create a new BillJob to handle asynchronous bill calculations for a specific
   * Organization.
   *
   * This operation allows you to initiate the processing of bills according to
   * specified parameters. For example, create a BillJob to run only those bills
   * where `billingFrequency` is `MONTHLY`. Note that if you want to run a BillJob
   * for all billing frequencies, simply omit the `billingFrequency` request
   * parameter.
   *
   * Once created, the BillJob's progress can be monitored:
   *
   * - In the Running Tasks panel in the m3ter Console - for more details, see
   *   [Running Bills Manually](https://www.m3ter.com/docs/guides/billing-and-usage-data/running-viewing-and-managing-bills/running-bills-and-viewing-bill-details#running-bills-manually)
   * - Queried using the
   *   [List BillJobs](https://www.m3ter.com/docs/api#tag/BillJob/operation/ListBillJobs)
   *   operation.
   *
   * **NOTES:**
   *
   * - **Consolidated bills**. If you've already run billing with the Consolidate
   *   bills option disabled for your Organization but you then enable it, subsequent
   *   Bills for specific bill dates will now start afresh and not update earlier
   *   non-consolidated Bills for the same bill date. To avoid any billing conflicts,
   *   you might want to archive these earlier versions or delete them entirely.
   * - **Maximum concurrent BillJobs**. If you already have 10 BillJobs currently
   *   running, and try to create another one, you'll get an HTTP 429 response (Too
   *   many requests). When one of the existing BillJobs has completed, you'll be
   *   able to submit another job
